**Column Definition:**
```tsx
const columns: Column<ClipResult>[] = [
  {
    key: 'game_name',
    title: 'Game',
    sortable: true,
    render: (value, item) => (
      <div className="flex items-center space-x-2">
        <GameIcon game={value} />
        <span>{value}</span>
      </div>
    )
  }
];
```

### 5. FileUpload Component (`components/ui/FileUpload.tsx`)
**Features:**
- Drag and drop support with visual feedback
- Multiple file selection
- File size validation with user feedback
- File type filtering
- Progress indicators during upload
- File list management with remove functionality
- File size formatting utilities
- File type icons for better UX

**Usage:**
```tsx
<FileUpload
  accept="video/*"
  multiple
  maxSize={500}
  onFilesSelect={handleFilesSelect}
  onRemoveFile={handleRemoveFile}
  files={uploadFiles}
  loading={isUploading}
/>
```

### 6. ProgressBar Component (`components/ui/ProgressBar.tsx`)
**Features:**
- Multiple variants: default, gaming, success, warning, danger
- 3 sizes: sm, md, lg
- Animated progress transitions
- Indeterminate mode for unknown progress
- Percentage and value display options
- Gradient backgrounds for gaming theme
- Label support with flexible positioning

**Usage:**
```tsx
<ProgressBar
  value={processingProgress}
  variant="gaming"
  showPercentage
  label="Processing Clip"
  animated
/>
```

## Enhanced Clips Page (`pages/clips-enhanced.tsx`)

The enhanced clips page demonstrates the power of the new component library:

### Key Improvements:

1. **Better Data Management**
   - Replaced manual table implementation with reusable DataTable
   - Added sortable columns for game, filename, size, and timestamp

   - Better loading states and empty state handling

2. **Enhanced Search & Filtering**
   - Integrated SearchBar component with filter support
   - Real-time search across filename and game name
   - Visual feedback for active filters
   - Clear search functionality

3. **Improved File Upload Experience**
   - Modal-based upload dialog for better focus
   - Drag and drop support with visual feedback
   - File validation and size limits
   - Progress tracking during upload
   - Batch file management with remove capability

4. **Better Visual Feedback**
   - Progress bars for processing status
   - Loading states throughout the interface
   - Animated interactions and transitions
   - Status indicators with color coding

5. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader friendly components
   - Focus management in modals

## Frontend Architecture Benefits

### 1. Reusability
- Components can be used across multiple pages
- Consistent design system implementation
- Reduced code duplication
- Easier maintenance and updates

### 2. Performance
- Framer Motion animations are GPU-accelerated
- Components are optimized for re-renders
- Proper memoization where needed
- Code splitting ready

### 3. Developer Experience
- Full TypeScript support with proper types
- Comprehensive prop interfaces
